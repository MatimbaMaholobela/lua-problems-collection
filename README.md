# Lua Problem Collection

This repository contains a collection of problems solved using Lua. The goal of this project is to improve problem-solving skills, explore Lua capabilities, and provide solutions to various coding challenges, from basic algorithms to more advanced problems. 

There is relatively little knowledge and resources available online specifically focused on Lua, and this repository aims to fill that gap by providing a variety of problems and solutions in Lua.

## About

The **Lua Problem Collection** is a curated set of coding challenges solved using the Lua programming language. Each problem is self-contained in its own directory with a description of the problem and the corresponding Lua solution. 

This collection aims to improve your understanding of Lua, whether you're a beginner or looking to explore more advanced features. Lua is an often-overlooked language, and there is not much detailed content or problem sets available to learn it. This repository was created to help bridge that gap, making it easier for anyone interested in Lua to find relevant coding challenges and solutions.
